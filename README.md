JamendoAngular
==============

Using AngularJS to consume some of the Jamendo API. [Demo site](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jwood803/JamendoAngular/blob/master/index.html).

A bit of help was given for some of the CSS:

**Normalize.css**
- - -
This was taken from another [GitHub repository](http://github.com/necolas/normalize.css). I use it in my own repository 
since I didn't feel right just linking to theirs straight out.

**Grid.css**
- - -
During one of the [Team Treehouse courses](http://teamtreehouse.com/), they had this in their project files. This was 
made from using the [Gridulator](http://gridulator.com/) site.
